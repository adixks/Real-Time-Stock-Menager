# ðŸš€ Microcurrency Exchange System
Welcome to the Microcurrency Exchange System, a microservices architecture for currency exchange information retrieval and processing!

## Components
1. **Currency Provider**
   - Regularly updates exchange rates from an API and sends them to a message queue (RabbitMQ).

2. **Currency Persistence Service**
   - Stores the latest rates from the queue in a database.

3. **Exchange API**
   - Provides endpoints for currency information and exchange, implements user authentication, and sends email notifications for exchange events.

4. **Mail Service**
   - Handles the construction and sending of email notifications.

## Running the System
To deploy the entire system, use Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will launch all components, including queues and databases, creating a seamless environment for microservices communication.

ðŸ‘‰ Note: Ensure that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system before running the above command.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Docker Compose command.

ðŸŒŸ Congratulations! Your Microcurrency Exchange System is now up and running.
