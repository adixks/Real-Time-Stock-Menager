Welcome to the Microcurrency Exchange System, a microservices architecture for currency exchange information retrieval and processing!

## Tools and Components ðŸ”§
[Java 17, Spring Boot 3, Spring Security, Spring Web MVC, Spring for Mail, JPA, REST API, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Docker, Lombok]

## Elements
1. **Currency Provider**
   - Regularly updates exchange rates from an API and sends them to a message queue (RabbitMQ).

2. **Currency Persistence Service**
   - Stores the latest rates from the queue in a database.

3. **Exchange API**
   - Provides endpoints for currency information and exchange, implements user authentication, and sends email notifications for exchange events.

4. **Mail Service**
   - Handles the construction and sending of email notifications.

## Running the System
To deploy the entire system, use Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will launch all components, including queues and databases, creating a seamless environment for microservices communication.

ðŸ‘‰ Note: Ensure that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system before running the above command.

## Getting Started
